# Steam-Visualizer
A treemap visualizer that shows the most popular games on Steam in 2024, you can sort by genre or category. Games can also be sorted by Peak CCU or Average Playtime

The database files I have are too big to put into this repo but it can be downloaded here

I have also normalized the data for my project so if you try to replicate it you will need to do this yourself, you can use the files I have that do this, it is just a bunch of the same sql over and over again to do this.
